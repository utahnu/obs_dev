[^1]: James 1:27 - "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, *and* to keep himself unspotted from the world."
[^2]: Moroni 7:35-37 - "...has the day of miracles ceased?     Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?     Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain."
