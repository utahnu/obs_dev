# obs_dev2


## *This repository is the collection of notes taken on Obsidian (in markdown) on obs_vault2.*

## Contents of obs_vault1

- Daily notes:
	- This folder contains .md files that correspond to that daily note. The daily note will contain links to the notes created that day, and information about the agenda and the tasks for that day.

## Notes for use

### Git & Github:
This note space is attached to a local repository and a github repository. With the use of plugin *Obsidian Git*, the command palette (brought up by using the command ctrl+p) can be used to commit, push, and do other commands. 
The main Obsidian Git commands I use are:
	`Commit all changes` and `Push`.
I use these two commands on a single branch in the repository. Later I may work on using different branches, but for now I feel like just using a single repository per vault. 

#### the process of linking a github repo includes:
- installing git
- creating a local repository and adding the related files
- authenticating with SSH and connecting to a github repository
- configuring Obsidian Git

the plugins should transfer over because they are contained within the vault, as well as the theme.

#### codespaces:
I also have the option of editing my notes on the web with a *github codespace*, and I would be doing so in VS code.

### CSS Snippets (the theme)
The only alteration I have made to the theme of Obsidian is the colors. The colors come from the theme *primary*. The section of code that defines each color variable has been copied, altered somewhat to account for missing the rest of the code, and enabled. 
Only the colors of the theme have been transferred into the CSS snippet., No other element is changed from the default Obsidian theme.
The file `color.css` is the CSS snippet that is currently active.
