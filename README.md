# obs_dev


## *This repository is the collection of notes taken on Obsidian (in markdown) on obs_dev.*

## Contents of obs_dev

- Daily notes:
	- This folder contains .md files that correspond to that daily note. The daily note will contain links to the notes created that day, and information about the agenda and the tasks for that day.
- Tags:
	- These will organize the markdown files themselves. They will be dated with each daily note, and may contain links to other documents outside of that tag. The tag itself identifies what the note was taken for.

## Notes for use

### Git & GitHub:
This note space is attached to a local repository and a github repository. With the use of plugin *Obsidian Git*, the command palette (brought up by using the command ctrl+p) can be used to commit, push, and other such commands. 
The main Obsidian Git commands I use most often are:
	`Commit all changes` and `Push`.
I use these two commands on a single branch in the repository. Later I may work on using different branches, but for now I feel like just using a single repository per vault. 

#### codespaces:
I also have the option of editing my notes on the web with a *github codespace*, and I would be doing so in VS code.

### CSS Snippets (the theme)
The only alteration I have made to the theme of Obsidian is the colors. The colors come from the theme *primary*. The section of code that defines each color variable has been copied, altered somewhat to account for missing the rest of the code, and enabled. 
Only the colors of the theme have been transferred into the CSS snippet., No other element is changed from the default Obsidian theme.
The file `color.css` is the CSS snippet that is currently active.
