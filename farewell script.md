> And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father![^1]

Let me begin with a saying of gratitude for all of you. How joyful I am that *you* have brought my soul unto Christ. How joyful I am that I have been reared and raised by loving parents, my mother and father, and my brothers and sisters, who have lovingly guided my soul to where I stand today, as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints!

I have had what seems like plenty of time to feel convincingly inadequate to be the face of the Restored Church of Jesus Christ, and to proclaim the joyful message that Jesus Christ lives! and that this is His church on the earth today! Many a night was I kept awake by racing thoughts of "how could I, little as I am, do this great and important work?" After a consultation with a trusted professor at BYU as I fell behind in his class, he replied like this:

> We're never fully qualified to do the things Christ asks us to do. He asks us to things we can't do (like walk on water, move mountains and seas, be made whole). But as we respond in faith to His invitations, He makes up the difference. So don't worry about whether you are qualified or not. Just focus on the Savior and He'll perform the miracles.

I stand before you today as one who still feels like he's coming short in many ways, but who is excited to find new ways to be carried by the Savior. And also one who is excited to share the incredible power, authority, love, and life of the Savior.

From what I have learned throughout my limited experience here on the earth, this redemptive love is the centrality of our Heavenly Father's plan, the center of *everything.* It is love; love that is centered in our Savior, Jesus Christ; that is the core of our being.

We have been called into the most binding and intimate relationships with our Eternal Family, that we together may experience the love, joy, peace, rest, comfort, safety, belonging, and redemption that comes through Jesus Christ.[^2]

A binding, selfless, and infinite love lies at the center of the creation, execution, and crowning conclusion of the Great Plan of our Heavenly Father. In no other place does this love exist than the family. Or in other words, the family is the basic unit of Heavenly Father's plan!

This familial love is the infinite love of our Eternal Father. It is the unmatched love of our Savior. It is the unfeigned love of our earthly parents and siblings. It is the ultimate and everlasting covenant between us and our king or queen.

For this purpose, Moroni pleaded,

> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is[^3]

This love is what we are doing when we receive ordinances and make covenants for our eternal family in the temple. This is what we are doing when we open our hearts to our mission calls, going anywhere in the world to proclaim this eternal love, and invite others unto Christ and the saving power of His Atonement.[^4]

Let us now focus on the greatest expression of love that reaches beyond all globes, galaxies, and universes to reach us. The Atonement of Jesus Christ. I am constantly moved by this miraculous truth. Abinadi powerfully taught,

> Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father.
> And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men-
> Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.[^5]

I, like Abinadi, testify of the living Christ, and of His victory over death. I am grateful for the opportunity each week to come here and remember Him, and promise to be His disciple as I partake of the sacrament. Additionally, I testify of the truth of the Book of Mormon, which contains Abinadi's words, that it is a testament of Jesus Christ, translated by the gift and power of God through His prophet, Joseph Smith.

The indescribable love of the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real. I testify that Christ is here, and is eager to give you comfort and peace. 

I encourage you to seek out the Atonement of Jesus Christ. But sometimes it can be hard to take that step. As Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, Simon Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."[^6]

We are afraid of Jesus cleansing our feet. We are coerced to feel ashamed that we are dirty, and lack strengths to show. But this fearful rejection is the antithesis of faithful discipleship. Jesus Christ “cuts through every sin, every storm, every story, every sea . . . the whole way through _for_ us, to be _with_ us.”[^7] All we have to do is turn to him, and feel of His love. We can experience a transformation beyond what we can imagine. With this truth, Simon Peter said, turning to Jesus,

> "...Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head"[^8]

And now, to me - as a missionary of Jesus Christ's church. Jesus continued to teach;

> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for *so* I am.
> If I then, *your* Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.[^9]

I have been called of God the Eternal Father, by His living prophets and apostles, in the name of the Son Jesus Christ, to be a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I have been recommended as one worthy to represent the Lord as a minister of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I will serve with all of my heart. I am grateful and excited to serve in this labor of love among this Eternal Family.
