there must needs be opposition in all things, and it is integral to real agency
it was not simply light and gray, it was light and darkness
some of us agreed to come to earth and suffer crushing defeats
lucifer wished to remove all these defeats, remove the opposition
but this would dam all, and the Father said I will not send thee
that all would not have to suffer, and all would return
as the grace and the salvation of the great plan, our father provided a savior
where, to his own pain, his children would suffer
but the savior would descend below all
and ascend into heaven, carrying all that was above on his shoulders
that all peace, all mercy, all salvation, comfort, peace, joy, all worlds without number, all beauty and light would be accessible for the joy of His children
and that God's work and glory - the immortality and eternal life of man - would inherit their divine thrones after having chosen good to become more like the Savior
and lucifer would continue his counterfeits, claiming there were other ways to heaven and peace
leading many astray on a  great and spacious building that lacked foundation
the foundation of Christ
who descended below all that he may lift all up through his grace, merits, and mercy
and he is with the children throughout the entire way
binding personally by covenant to be born in Him
continuing to gift, comfort, protect, better, bind, endow, seal, and exalt those covenant children
that they may really become like Him
