# History of Machine Learning

## Five Major Schools of Thought:

- **Knowledge Engineering**
	- Intelligence comes from manually coded knowledge
	- Handcrafted rules, decision trees
- **Connectionists**
	- Intelligence comes from biologically inspired structures
	- Artificial neural networks [deep learning]
- **Evolutionaries**
	- Intelligence comes through evolution
	- The greatest computer is nature, best algorithm is evolution
- **Bayesians**
	- Intelligence comes from accurately representing probabilities
	- Bayes' Theorem
- **Analogizers**
	- Intelligence comes from looking at analogies, similar examples
	- Support vector machines, nearest neighbors

> [!what is machine learning:]
> 'Changes in [a] system that ... enable [it] to do the same task or tasks drawn from the same population more efficiently and more effectively the next time.' (Simon 1983)
> 
> Two ways that a system can improve:
> - By acquiring new knowledge
> 	- acquire new facts, skills
> - By adapting its behavior
> 	- solve problems more accurately, efficiently


> [!What is learning?]
> Herbert Simon: "Learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience"

> [!What is the task?]
> - Classification
> - Categorization/clustering
> - Problem solving/planning/control
> - Prediction

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning**
	- Learning with no human feedback
- **Supervised Learning**
	- Learning with human feedback
- **Reinforcement Learning**
	- Indirect feedback, after several trials
