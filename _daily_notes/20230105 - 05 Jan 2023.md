## Initialization
This first daily note is an initialization of the daily_notes and the general_notes templates.
It was created as a test and development environment for this workflow.

In a regular use case, this section would work as the scratchpad, while the logistical data (created notes and tasks) is handled automatically with the dataview snippets baked into the template.
