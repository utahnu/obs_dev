We have been called into the most binding and intimate relationships with our Eternal Family, that we may experience the love, joy, peace, rest, comfort, safety, belonging, and redemption, together in our Savior.

This love is what we are doing when we receive ordinances and make covenants for our eternal sisters and brothers. This is what we are doing when we open our hearts to our mission calls, going anywhere to share this eternal love, and the unique and miraculous expression of that love in the ordinances and covenants of God.

A binding, selfless, and infinite love lies at the center of the creation, execution, and crowning conclusion of the great plan of our loving Heavenly Father. In no other place does this love exist than the family. Or in other words, family is the basic unit of our Heavenly Father's plan! 

It is the infinite love of our Eternal Father. It is the unmatched love of our Savior. It is the unfeigned love of our earthly parents and siblings. It is the ultimate and everlasting covenant between us and our king or queen.

The core of our being is built on a foundation of love. 

It may be perceived that the most righteous and the truest disciples use the Atonement the least. In this way, "a covenant partnership with Christ will always look like a crutch that must be outgrown in order to achieve 'real' perfection." (Adam Miller)

Jesus Christ is the purpose of both our focus, and our destination. Because the Atonement of Jesus Christ is the purest, and most powerful form of love across globes, galaxies, and universes. 

> Sin is my rejection of God's original offer of grace and partnership ... It's me trying desperately to cobble together, through any means necessary ... some bundle of good things that more closely matches what I wanted than what God gave ... It's me choosing the hollow isolation of fantasies over the shared difficulty of God's reality. (Adam Miller)

> Neither death ... nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 8:38-39)

> "Don't be part of what would surely be the most tragic of all stories of unrequited love by refusing to feel the transformative, soul-changing love that God and Christ offer you ... Please, let Him love you." (Kevin J. Worthen)

We are afraid of Jesus Christ cleansing our feet. We are coerced to feel ashamed that we are dirty, and that we lack strengths to show. But this fearful rejection is the antithesis of faithful discipleship. 

> "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head" (John 13:9)

> He "cuts through every sin, every storm, every story, every sea ... the whole way through for us, to be with us."

It is no wonder why the transcendent promise of our first covenant is that we might always have His Spirit to be with us. 

> That they may all be as one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us...
> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

To be known means intimacy - with all of its attendant fear of self-exposure, of being seen and known in all that we are and all that we are not. It means responsibility and profound trustworthiness so that will be safe in our care. 

> We’re never fully qualified to do the things Christ asks us to do. He asks us to do things we can’t do (like walk on water, rise up and walk, be made whole, etc.). But as we respond in faith to His invitations, He makes up the difference.
> So don’t worry about whether you are qualified or not. Just focus on the Savior and He’ll perform the miracles.

> We fear that our pain and loss is a mark of “accusation”—that being single, never married, divorced, or infertile; struggling in marriage; having suffered abuse; wrestling with questions of gender or sexuality; or any other seeming difference from the ideal marks us as less worthy, second tier, not belonging. Instead He says, “Come, share it all with me.” He tells us:

> For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. . . .
> . . . Thou wast precious in my sight . . . , and I have loved thee. . . .
> Fear not: for I am with thee.

> Thus, the doctrine of belonging comes down to this—each one of us can affirm: Jesus Christ died for me; He thought me worthy of His blood. He loves me and can make all the difference in my life. As I repent, His grace will transform me. I am one with Him in the gospel covenant; I belong in His Church and kingdom; and I belong in His cause to bring redemption to all of God’s children.

> “Once you and I have made a covenant with God, our relationship with Him becomes much closer than before our covenant. Now we are bound together. Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us. Each of us has a special place in God’s heart. …
