# Evidences and Discussion:

## Partisanship -> Political Parties

*U Minnesota 10.1*

- Define Political parties
- Political Parties ingrained in US History (Federalist 10/Faction, emergence of a party system)

> Parties evolved from factions in the eighteenth century to political machines in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, parties underwent waves of reform that some argue initiated a period of decline. The renewed parties of today are service-oriented organizations dispensing assistance and resources to candidates and politicians 
> (Minnesota 10.1)

	- Heavy north/south division
	- Political parties aligned with Union/Confederate and related values
- Political Machines and Bossism:
	- Partisanship shifts to being based on unifying groups rather than ideology
- Progressivism and Merit Systems:
	- Political machines and patronage are broken down with Civil Service
	- Advocated for political machines
- FDR, the New Deal, and the Cold War
- Candidate-centered Politics

## Political parties are indispensable

- Political parties provide indispensable majorities that can forward agenda in a democratic scene
- Political parties are required to appeal to voters and align with their interests to retain a majority, upholding a representative democracy

> Political parties' never-ending quests for a winning coalition that will control the mechanisms of government power are crucial for representative democracy. Parties stand for things; they have policy agendas and broad, programmatic goals about what they want to accomplish. To achieve these goals they must win elections, and in order to win elections, parties must appeal to voters and their interests. Without this dynamic, the representative element of America's representative democracy would be significantly diminished.
