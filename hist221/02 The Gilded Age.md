# Labor in the Gilded Age

[[02-04 Labor in the Gilded Age]]

Thus, workers have these rights to choose, but these rights are used to refuse legislation that assist the laborer

***Ex:*** A State cannot pass a law that limits work hours to 10 hours because that takes away the freedom of workers who want to work more than 10 hours
