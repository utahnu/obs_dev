# Depression and the Decline of Liberal Democracy

The end of World War I had seen a global increase in liberal democracy:
- Female Suffrage
- Universal Suffrage

**Countries around the world:**

| 1900                | 1921                |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 21% are democracies | 44% are democracies | 

> [!Liberal Democracy:]
> An equality and majority-rules form of government where the power of the majority is constrained by institutions that protect individual and minority rights
> 
> (a 20th century concept)

==Depression --> Decline in Democracy==

## The Global Great Depression initiates a worldwide ==decline== in democracy

By 1943, 23% of countries are democracies (13 countries)

**Fascism and totalitarianism spread across the world**

> [!Fascism:]
> A political ideology of ==hyper-nationalism== that emphasizes dictatorship and the organization of society for the good of the nation, not of the individual.
> 
> [liberalism and democracy are lies]
> (far-right ideology)

- 1919:
	- Fascism begins in Italy with political party and ideology founded by **Benito Mussolini**
- by 1939:
	- Fascist parties exist in most countries (including the US)

> [!Totalitarianism:]
> A Political system (not ideology) of dictatorship where the individual is subservient to the state in every aspect of their lives - not just politics

> [!Corporatism]
> The organization of society (by the state) into non-competitive interest-representation-groups based on social status that facilitate indirect participation in the government.

## Lawrence Lowell - "The Present Crisis in Democracy" - *Foreign Affairs* (1934)

- Democracies across the world are falling apart
- It is possible (though unlikely) that **Franklin D. Roosevelt will emerge as first dictator** of the United States

> "When President Harding told the country to return to normalcy he was urging what did not - as we now see could not - take place; for human nature being as it is, speculation and inflated prices followed by a collapse were almost inevitable. He proved to be as mistaken as a prophet as President Wilson was when he said that we were fighting in the war to make the world safe for democracy; for three of the largest nations engaged have since repudiated popular government altogether, two of them on the side of the victors, and one of the vanquished."
> 
> \- Lawrence Lowell - *Foreign Affairs*

## John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)

*A British Economist*
Develops Keynesian Theory:

### Keynesian Theory (1936)

- The government can stabilize economies in crisis by increasing demand
	- Capitalist free-markets have no self-balancing mechanisms
- In times of economic crisis when demand collapses, **the government should increase spending (to increase demand)** [Deficit Spending]
	- Spending should be focused on labor intensive projects - especially infrastructure
- When the demand side of the economy becomes to strong, governments should lower spending and raise taxes to prevent inflation

==This theory is not socialism==

**Dominant economic theory until the 1970s**

> "The political problem of mankind is to combine three things: economic efficiency, social justice, and individual liberty."
> 
> \- John Maynard Keynes- 1926 lecture

---

## Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992)

*An Austrian economist*
Opposes Keynes

### Hayekian Theory (1940)

- Free market capitalism is not a perfect solution - but is the best solution
- Government intervention into the economy leads to authoritarianism (even if it's unintentional)
	- *see Franklin D. Roosevelt's Inaugural speech*
	- Kills democracy
- Spending to create demand creates fake demand in areas that are unnatural to economic growth
	- Spending will have to be maintained forever, lest the demands disappear
- It is impossible for the government to know everything all at once
	- Thus cannot make correct decisions about where to spend

**Dominant in the 1980s**

> "The recognition of the insuperable limits to his knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of society a lesson in humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice in men's fatal striving to control society - a striving which makes him not only a tyrant over his fellows, but which may well make him the destroyer of a civilization which no brain has designed but which has grown from the free efforts of millions of individuals."
> 
> \-Friedrich August von Hayek - *The Pretence of Knowledge* (1974)
